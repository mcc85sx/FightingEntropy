Kerberos, the hound of Hades... the 3 headed dog.
But also, the moon of Pluto.
Pluto happens to be the farthest of the original 9 planets...
So... not trying to brag about it..? 
But- that's how far out Kerberos truly is.
 
Anyway, before I talk about Kerberos the network authentication protocol...
I want to talk about the fabled beast that the protocol was named after.
 
Because, the mere mentioning of the name "Kerberos" used to send chills 
down people's spines.
Back in Greek times, if the word Kerberos was even whispered, some people 
would freak out.
 
Because some guy would say the name, and then people would ask...
 
Person: *gulp* You mean the hound of Hades?
Some guy: *brief pause* ...Yeh. The hound of Hades.
Person: *starts sweating* Ohhhh boy, I don't like the sound of that...
Some guy: It's- just the name. No need to be afraid of it.
Person: Yeah right pal, I've heard about this beast... the 3 headed dog 
that guards the gates of the underworld.
Some guy: Yeah...? Your point?
Person: ...stands at the gate all the time to keep the dead from leaving.
 
Anyway, in modern times, it doesn't cause as much dread because it's meant 
to be a non-secure/secure transition layer for network communications. 
There may be dread in how effective it is, but...
...it's nothing to crap your pants over.
