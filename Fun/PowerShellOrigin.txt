Once upon a time, there were a bunch of experts at sitting around.
Pounding away at their keyboards… 
...at the location where the world’s best software engineering takes place.
1 Microsoft Way, Redmond WA 98052

It was just another day at the office, when suddenly... 
...one of those experts said to another…

Expert #1: Hey, you know what? 
Expert #2: ...what?
Expert #1: We need an extremely versatile AND powerful tool, to get stuff done.
Expert #2: But we have a lot of those already.
Expert #1: Yeah, but… we have a lot of those already.
Expert #2: I just said that...
Expert #1: I meant that we have way too many. 
Expert #2: *sigh* Man… you’re right.
Expert #1: We need to find a way to join them together into one powerful tool.
Expert #2: That’s… nonsense man. How could we do that…?
Expert #1: Suppose we had something that could run them all?
Expert #2: Isn’t that what cmd.exe is for?
Expert #1: Yeah… but- we could make a way better cmd.exe
Expert #2: ...could we?
Expert #1: I don’t know man. We have to think of a way.
Expert #2: I am inclined to agree.
Expert #1: It’s gotta be something that doesn’t need to be compiled, to run.
Expert #2: You’re blowing my mind right now. I’ve been thinking the same thing.

And so, the race was on in order to build this extremely versatile AND powerful tool.

At which point, days later... an expert came bursting into the room with an idea.
An idea that sounded cool, but also worked incredibly well, too.
That idea eventually became…
“PowerShell”.

For years, people used BASIC to develop applications.
Then, a guy by the name of Jeffrey Snover told red rover to move over…
...and now we have PowerShell 7.
