PowerShell 7 + Windows Terminal, a match made by the gods themselves

Once upon a time, there were a bunch of people sitting around.
One that just decided to *really* up the ante on their (widely/historically) known
ability to engineer the best software on the planet.

After a number of years continually attempting to one-up themselves...?
They noticed an ameteur who stood no chance whatsoever, against the cosmos, alone.

Impressed, with his imbuement of mystical power of (writing/narration) capabilities...
...when combined with the total raw horsepower behind PowerShell 7...?

Maybe you oughtta stop and ask yourself...
...if you somehow got invited to an action packed cinematic event.

The only problem with PowerShell 7 + Windows Terminal...
...is that you won't want to stop using it.

It's like pringles, but better.
No contenders on the table, that have as much potential.

Could you imagine if perhaps... some guys that have been doing this a long time...
didn't think that it could come down to this?

Some senior engineers sat around and watched in shock and awe at the ameteur...
...as if he were slaying demons in a video game. On Mars. Or, wherever.
