# [Cim-db] In active development (new release imminent as of 9/7/2021)
Company Information Management Database is a testing environment for a working database, for point-of-sale
and business transactions. It uses a combination of (C#/PowerShell/.Net) class types, Extensible Application
Markup Language/XAML, Windows Presentation (Foundation|Framework)/WPF, with DataBinding/MVVM synchronizing 
the PowerShell components to the GUI.

In it's current state, the module is broken down into several classes and functions.
Some things in FightingEntropy work in Linux, some things don't.
The "Write-Theme" function was written specifically to work on each platform that PowerShell supports.
Other namespaces don't work fully, and the linux side development has taken a back seat for the time being.
